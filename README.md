## Timed Quiz Application 


### In this application I attempted to create a Trivia Game in which the user is asked trivia questions about The Beatles. I was able to create a mock up website and I was able to have the application ask the user a couple of questions as well as create a timer and let users know the rules of the game. 

### I used the following resources to help me build my code 
```
taskinator app 
robot gladiators app 
bootcamp lessons 
Module 4
```
### I tried to stay away from any websites to try and create this with my own intellectual property and this was the result. It ain't much, but it's honest work. 

The following image shows a screenshot of the application.
